# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML-Models-KNN-SVM-RF-ANN-
This project applies various machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)—to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of results.
