# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML-Models (KNN-SVM-RF-ANN)

Heart disease continues to be a major global health concern, and early detection is key to preventing serious outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical data — with the ultimate goal of supporting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.

🧠 Objective The core aim of this project is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models that can classify whether an individual is at risk of heart disease, based on attributes like age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more.

📊 Key Features 📁 Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset includes 1000+ records and 14 important health-related features.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing:

Removed outliers and duplicate records

Handled missing values using imputation

Selected features based on correlation analysis

🧪 Models Used:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest (RF)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

🔗 Ensemble Learning: Combined all models using soft voting to enhance prediction accuracy and stability.

💡 Motivation Real-world impact: Cardiovascular diseases are often preventable — early prediction can truly save lives.

Learning opportunity: A great exercise in comparing machine learning models for classification problems.

Scalable potential: These models can be adapted for use in actual healthcare tools and systems.
